This project aims to teach developers about the concept of layers in software development. 
The app uses React and socket.io to build a chess game.

As a challenge you should fork the project and refactor the application creating a **View/Presentation Layer**, a **State Layer**, a **Logic/Business Layer**, a **Domain Layer** and an **Infrastructure Layer**.
